# [Grav SectionWidget Plugin][project]

## About

`SectionWidget` is a plugin for [**Grav**](http://getgrav.org).
This readme describes version 0.1.0.


## Issues

Please open a new [issue][issues] for defects or new functionality.


## Installation and Updates

There's a manual install and update method by downloading
[this plugin](https://github.com/aptly-io/grav-plugin-sectionwidget)
and extracting all plugin files to `</your/site>/grav/user/plugins/sectionwidget`.

Alternatively, Grav has a
[command line tool, bin/gpm](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm)
to manage this plugin's life-cycle.


## Usage

The plugin comes with a sensible and self explanatory default
[plugin configuration (`sectionwidget.yaml`)](sectionwidget.yaml),
a [layout (`templates/partials/sectionwidget.html.twig`)](templates/partials/sectionwidget.html.twig)
and a [styling (`assets/css/sectionwidget.css`)](assets/css/sectionwidget.css) for antimatter.


### Integrate the plugin's twig template into the theme

The partial twig needs integration into the theme.


### Group content with the SectionWidget's configuration header


Here's an extended configuration example:

```yaml
```


``` markdown
```
