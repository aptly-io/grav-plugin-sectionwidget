# [Grav SectionWidget Plugin][project]

## About

`SectionWidget` is a plugin for [**Grav**](http://getgrav.org).
This readme describes version 0.1.1.
The plugin splits, with special _section marker_, large content into sections.
The content of a section is up to the author.
It creates a configurable HTML widget that lets one navigate to the first, previous, next or last section.
Or a drop down menu that jumps directly into a specific section.
Only one section or all sections are visible at a time.
The widget layout is done with a partial twig template.
The included CSS styling fits well with the antimatter theme.

Your reasons for splitting content into sections might be:
* To make the content more digestible
* Your readers might prefer to peek into the conclusion first 
* The content type makes clicking next, next, next ... more natural (e.g. a series of lyrics)
* ...

These screen shots gives you an idea how this might look like. The page is opened with all sections visible.

## Issues

Please open a new [issue][issues] for defects or new functionality requests.


### Known limitations

Here are some limitation:

* You can only have one section widget per page 
  (so it does not make much sense for modular pages).
* The section plugin does not integrate perfectly with the similar named 
  [GroupWidget](https://github.com/aptly-io/grav-plugin-groupwidget) plugin.
* Sections don't open up automatically when selecting a link inside these from the 
  [TOC](https://github.com/sommerregen/grav-plugin-toc/blob/master/README.md) plugin.


## Installation and Updates

There's a manual install and update method by downloading
[this plugin](https://github.com/aptly-io/grav-plugin-sectionwidget)
and extracting all plugin files to `</your/site>/grav/user/plugins/sectionwidget`.

Alternatively, Grav has a
[command line tool, bin/gpm](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm)
to manage this plugin's life-cycle.


## Usage

The plugin comes with a sensible and self explanatory default
[plugin configuration (`sectionwidget.yaml`)](sectionwidget.yaml),
a [layout (`templates/partials/sectionwidget.html.twig`)](templates/partials/sectionwidget.html.twig)
and a [styling (`assets/css/sectionwidget.css`)](assets/css/sectionwidget.css) for antimatter.


### Integrate the plugin's twig template into the theme

The partial twig needs integration into the theme.
This diff shows how that can be done for the [screen shots above](#screenshot), 
in antimatter theme's default.html.twig

```diff
 {% extends 'partials/base.html.twig' %}
 
 {% block content %}
+    {% if config.plugins.sectionwidget.enabled %}
+        {% include 'partials/sectionwidget.html.twig' %}
+    {% endif %}
+
 	{{ page.content }}
 {% endblock %}
```

### SectionWidget's configuration

Here's an extended configuration example:

```yaml
enabled: true                                        # enabled by default
built_in_css: true                                   # use the build-in css
marker: ======                                       # the section marker
controls: [ first, prev, fullmenu, next, last]       # controls to show
initial: 0                                   # supports full as well (whole page visible)

```

* `marker` allows to redefine the section marker (in case the default clashes with other uses).
* `controls` holds the list of controls that are rendered in the section widget.
  * `first`, `prev`, `next` and `last` are navigation button controls
  * `fullmenu` is a drop down control from which to select a section
     The last menu item does not corresponds with a particular section: it shows the whole pages at once. 
* `initial` has the value of the shown section when the page is opened.
  The value `full` with show all sections; the whole page.


### The section marker

The content of a section is everything between 2 section markers (or the end of the file).
This marker is specified with the `marker` (by default six consecutive equals signs `======`).
The menu items in the drop down menu that represent each section, 
are taken from the first `H<x>` element after the section marker that is not empty.
If a section does not contain any header element,
or on the contrary multiple titled paragraphs,
put a descriptive title right after the section marker.

The markdown content right before the very first section marker, 
does not end up in its own section; it's shown in from of each single section.

Here's the markdown content that resulted in the [screen shots above](#screenshot).
It illustrates:
* The whole page is opened; all sections are visible due to the option `initial: full` 
* Some content in front of the first section marker
* The use of a title right after the section marker (`Section 2 Most work` and `Footnotes`)
* Three sections (The footnotes is a separate section)

``` markdown
